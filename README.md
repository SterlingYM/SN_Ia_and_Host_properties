We thank our referee, Benjamin Rose, whose feedback led to a sub-stantial improvement of our initial manuscript. Y.S.M. is also gratefulto Mariska Kriek for an eye-opening conversation about SPS modelsand the diversity in predictions they produce. We thank Thomas deJaeger for helpful discussions on the mass-step and Andrew Hoff-man for proofreading.
